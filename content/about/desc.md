My name is Miguel Silva and I am 22 years old. I am currently attending the 5th year of the integrated MSc in Informatics Engineering at the University of Minho and also working as a Software Developer. My main goal is to apply my skills in projects and learn, gain experience, enlarging my skill set. I want to focus on developing robust and useful software. In my free time I usually read, run, watch some tv series or movies and spend time with my friends and family.
