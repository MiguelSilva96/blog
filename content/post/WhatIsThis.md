My first post.

<!--more-->

First of all, welcome to my blog. My name is Miguel Silva and I am from Portugal. I'm currently finishing my masters in Informatics Engineering at the University of Minho. I'm also a Software Developer at a company that focuses on management software.

Well, I don't really know what this blog will be about, but I will make a guess... You should expect articles related to computer science and programming in general (maybe some frameworks, techniques...).
But there is room for some wild topics. I like to read and watch tv series, so that could lead to a review (**very unlikely**).

Let's just hope this isn't the only post here.

As this is my first post and I don't know what to write, I'll just paste a sunrise picture here to make it seem longer.
